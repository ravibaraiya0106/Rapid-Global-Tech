        <h2 class="clr-white">Why Profitability Analysis Matters</h2>
        <p class="clr-white">Most businesses track revenue. Fewer track profitability with the level of detail needed to
            truly understand what's working and what's draining resources. When decisions are based solely on sales or
            basic gross margin, you risk:</p>

            <div class="risk-item">
                <p class="clr-white">Pricing too low to cover true costs</p>

        <div class="profit-quote">
            <p class="clr-white">"Profitability is not one number on your income statement — it's a layered picture
                across customers, products, and operational inputs. Our service reveals that picture clearly and

        <h2>What Our Profitability Analysis Service Covers</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">We offer a full-spectrum analysis that integrates data from your sales, operations, finance,
            and logistics systems to generate actionable insights.</p>

        <div class="features-accordion">
            <!-- Feature 1 -->
            <div class="accordion-item">
                <button class="accordion-header">
                    <span>1</span>
                    <h3>Brand-wise and Part-wise Profit Margin Calculations</h3>
                    <i class="arrow"></i>
                </button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Every brand and every product you sell has a different impact on your profit margin. Some may
                        appear successful due to high volume but actually deliver poor profitability due to high costs
                        or discounts.</p>
                    <p>We dig deep into:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brand-level margin reports to compare profitability across your product portfolio</li>
                        <li>Part-level cost and revenue tracking to uncover underperforming SKUs</li>
                        <li>Analysis of direct and indirect costs associated with each brand or part</li>
                        <li>Cost allocation for shared resources (warehousing, marketing, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This enables you to make clear decisions on which brands or parts to promote, phase out, bundle,
                        or redesign — backed by real data, not guesswork.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Not all customers are created equal. Some bring in consistent profits over time, while others are
                        high-maintenance, price-sensitive, or one-off buyers who cost more than they contribute.</p>
                    <p>Our service includes:</p>

                        <li>Segmentation by behavior: Identify patterns between recurring vs one-time buyers</li>
                        <li>Customer lifetime value (CLV) estimation tied to profit, not just revenue</li>
                        <li>Cost-to-serve analysis: Including support costs, returns, discounts, and payment behavior
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We help you target the right customers, improve retention strategies, and decide when to walk
