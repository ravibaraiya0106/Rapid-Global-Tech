                  <li>Establishment of a preferred supplier list tailored to each category, region, and product
                     complexity</li>
                  <li>Onboarding of approved suppliers, including documentation collection, contract structuring, and

               <h3>üí¨ Negotiation Strategy & Execution</h3>
